# Exawind Demo Problem

Rotating laminar cyinder in a cross flow with nested refinement
Eventually this should be turbulent/turn on turbulence models to test the same code paths used for turbine runs

Nearbody meshes:
- cylinder3d_nearbody_2k.g (no refinement, what we have in the regression suite)
- cylinder3d_nearbody_18k.g (1 level of refinement)
- cylinder3d_nearbody_146k.g (2 level of refinement)
